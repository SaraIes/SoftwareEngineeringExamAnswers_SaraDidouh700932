a)	Select a development method for this project and provide the reason for your choice, (e.g. waterfall development method, agile development method, etc.).

I would use the waterfall model. This one is the one that adapts better to the characteristics of the project due to the fact that is linear and sequential. With this method you have to finish each task before moving on and starting the following task; which I think is essential for this type of project to assure that each part works correctly.


b)	Provide a comprehensive list of the steps involved in the software development process.

-	Requirement gathering and analysis
-	Design and prototyping
-	Development
-	Testing
-	Deploying
-	Maintenance


c)	Write a requirement document based on the client's previous requirements, including functional requirements, interface requirements infrastructure requirements.

Functional requirements:
-	The user should be able to create an account and log in.
-	The machines should display the client's account balance.
-	Machines should allow clients to withdraw money.
-	Machines should allow clients to deposit money.
-	The user should be able to customize the possible settings.

Interface requirements:
-	The design should be responsive to be shown correctly in any type of device.
-	The design has to be clear and comprehensive.
-	The navigation through the platform should be clear and easy to use for all ages.

Infrastructure requirements:
-	The platform has to be scalable to allow large capacity of users.
-	The platform has to be secure to protect user’s data.
-	The platform has to be hosted in a high-performance server with enough capacity of storage.


d)	Create a Use Case Diagram.

-	As a user I want to be able to sign in and log in.
-	As a user I want to be able to see my account balance.
-	As a user I want to be able to withdraw money.
-	As a user I want to be able to deposit cash or checks.
-	As a user I want to be able to customize settings.
-	As a user I want to be able to report possible problems.


e)	Create a Gantt Chart to manage development process.

-	Requirement gathering and analysis – ½ week
-	Design and prototyping – 1 week
-	Development – 2 weeks
-	Testing and quality assurance - ½ week
-	Deploying and maintenance - ongoing


f)	Provide an example code snippet, in any programming language, that includes the class name, function name, and any other necessary variables, to demonstrate how to achieve the goals of this project. You do not need to include the implementation details of the functions. Please show class diagrams or template code.

g)	Provide a detailed explanation of the validation and verification process that should be followed to ensure the successful completion of this project.

First of all, the client has to validate that all the information in the requirement document is correct. Then the prototyping and design is made and the client has to validate it. Once done, the pertinent changes can be made and start with the development of the project. To validate that it is working correctly tests will be done (unit testing, integration testing, end to end testing). If the user verificates that all the information is correct and accepts the correct functionality of the software, this can be deployed and start working.


h)	Create a repository on GitHub and upload your answers to it. Please note that the answers on GitHub will not be considered for marking, so it is essential to submit all your answers to Moodle before the exam deadline.
